# Music Recommender

## Overview
This project is a Python-based music recommendation system that suggests songs based on user preferences or song features using machine learning. Built as a 20-day portfolio project, it aims to demonstrate skills in data science, machine learning, and software development. As a beginner in Python and ML, Iâ€™m using this project to learn data preprocessing, content-based filtering, and system integration, with the goal of understanding and explaining every component explored during the project.

## Project Goals
- Develop a recommendation system using content-based filtering (e.g., based on song features like genre, tempo).
- Learn and apply Python libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook.
- Practice data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ML algorithm implementation.
- Document the development process and learning outcomes for portfolio showcase.
- Host the project on GitHub with clear setup instructions and reproducible code.
- Explore Full Stack developement and gain relevant knowledge. 

## Current Status
As of Day 1 (June 5, 2025), the project is in the setup phase:
- Python environment configured with a virtual environment.
- Installed libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Jupyter.
- GitHub repository initialized with `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt`.

## Planned Features
- Load and preprocess a music dataset (e.g., Million Song Dataset or Spotify API data).
- Perform EDA to understand song features and user preferences.
- Implement a content-based recommendation algorithm.
- Create a simple command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
- Build a basic web interface using Flask if time permits.
- Evaluate recommendations using metrics like precision.

## Technologies
- Programming: Python 3.8+
- Libraries: pandas (data manipulation), NumPy (numerical operations), scikit-learn (ML algorithms), Jupyter Notebook (EDA and experimentation)
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code
- Dataset: To be determined (exploring Million Song Dataset, Last.fm, or Spotify API
